{ its odd to me that we continually talk about the homeless problem - needing to stimulate the economy - infrastructureon the news yet we haven't come together and built a solid
foundation for a future to be built uppon we throw taxpayer money at the problems not at the cause my solution is simple and back to the basics and wont create a tax increase because it creates new taxpayers
