                        BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT
    THIS IS A ALL HANDS ON DECK REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE WITH GRANT SUBMITTING  PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS THERE ARE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHY THIS SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE  
AS A LETTER OF INTENT AND RESPONDED TO ACCORDINGLY  A.S.A.P

MY NAME IS JOHN WESLEY PIMENTEL I AM THE FOUNDER OF 
STEPPING UP IN FAITH GDC NONPROFIT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION 
A LITTLE ABOUT ME BORN PORTLAND OR . I'M 42 YEAR OLD
MEXICAN / AMERICAN  I  AM LEARNING DISABLED AND I HAVE MADE SOME CHOICES IN LIFE I WISH DIDN'T 

 I'VE BEEN A ADDICT SINCE 14 YEARS OLD FOR THE FIRST TIME TRIED TO GET CLEAN 3 YEARS AGO AND I'M HOMELESS 

FROM MY EXPERIENCE  YOU TELL ME TO DO SOMETHING THATS THE BEST WAY TO GET ME TO DO THE OPPOSITE AND THATS WHY IM CONTACTING YOU NOW  

WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO AFTER A LOT OF THOUGHT IS COORDINATE A  COOPERATIONAL ARRANGEMENT  BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN  MY PROGRAM IT IS A RESEARCH  PROGRAM CONSISTING  OF HOUSING EMPLOYMENT AND CARING RESOURCES  

THE IDEA IS YOU GET OUT WHAT YOU PUT IN 

THE PROGRAM IS 100% VOLUNTARY  ANYONE CAN USE THE PROGRAM FOR 6 MONTHES ABSOLUTELY FREE NO OBLIGATIONS  BUT TO KEEP THE PROGRAM AVAILABLE PAST 6 MONTHES THEY MUST ACTIVELY  PARTICIPATE WITH EMPLOYMENT OR JOB TRAING OR SCHOOLING SERVICES 

THEIR IS MULTIPUL REASONS WHY THE CHOICE OF PROVIDING ME WITH FUNDING AND RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT  MY PLAN  IS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION  

1   I AM PART OF THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY AND KNOW THEM 

2  THE ABLITY TO ADAPT  AND ACCOMPLISH MY GOAL  EVEN THOUGH I HAVE ISSUES I WILL FIND AWAY TO SUCCEED

3   I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THAT WE AS A WHOLE HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT OUR APPROACH AND THINGS CAN BE SO MUCH BETTER AND AM WILLING TO HAVE THE COUNCIL OF NITPICKERS OVERSEEING EVERYTHING BECAUSE I'M  NOT STUPID THATS THE ONLY WAY YOU ALL WILL LET IT HAPPEN 

4  RESULTS I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THERE WILL BE NOTICEABLE RESULTS AS IN LESS DEMAND ON RESORCES AND A INCRESS OF TAXPAYERS  CLEANER STREETS AND BUILDING COMMUNITY BONDS

5  JUST TAKING  SERVICES THAT ALREADY HAVE FUNDING AND DIRECTING SOME OF THE SERVICES TO MY PROGRAM BY MY ROUGH CALCULATIONS THE GOVERNMENT WILL SAVE 500,000 A YEAR OFF OF JUST 1 PROJECT AND WITH A 10% SUCCESS RATE WERE CREATING 400,000 OF TAXABLE INCOME AND THATS OUT OF 100 PEOPLE 1 PROJECT 

6 THIS PROJECT IS NOT GOING TO STEAL FUNDING FROM OTHERS THAT ARE WORKING ON THE SAME GOAL IT IS DESIGNED TO  PROVIDE THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THE ABILITY TO USE A ON SITE LOCATION TO BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY WE ARE TRYING TO HELP 

                      RESEARCH KEY FOR SYSTEM CHANGE
7 AND THROUGH THAT OF HAVING ALL THE RESOURCES AROUND EACH OTHER AND ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE SYSTEM IS FAILING AND HAVING INPUT FROM TAXPAYERS AND THE HOMELESS THEMSELVES  BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WE CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM IS TOGETHER  

WHAT I NEED IS TO SIT DOWN AND TALK MY WHOLE PLAN OUT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND THE FUNDING TO DO IT  BECAUSE IF YOUR ASKING FOR THE INFO I CAN GIVE IT
BUT I'M JUST RUNNING IN CIRCLES  APPLYING  FOR  GRANTS SETTING UP FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT I DONT KNOW  OR UNDERSTAND AND NEED HELP PUTTING THIS TOGETHER 

BUT THE PEOPLE THAT NEED HELP THATS WHAT I DO KNOW SO IF ANY OF YOU CAN COME DOWN TO NEAR STREET LEVEL I WILL CLIMB OUT OF THE GUTTER AND WASH UP SO WE CAN HOPEFULLY  SEE EYE TO EYE AND GET SOMETHING DONE FOR A CHANGE
